# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for this project and provides instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please do not create a public issue. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Send an Email:**  
   Contact our security team directly at **simonestranieri2518@gmail.com**.  
   *Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce the issue, and any relevant version information.*

2. **Confidentiality:**  
   Your report will be handled confidentially. We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until it has been resolved.

## Vulnerability Response Process

Our Security Response Team will:
- **Acknowledge Receipt:**  
  We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
  
- **Investigation:**  
  Our team will investigate the reported issue to determine its severity and impact.
  
- **Resolution:**  
  If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and release a patch in a timely manner. Security patches may be released as part of a minor version update or as an emergency patch.
  
- **Disclosure:**  
  Once a patch is available and deployed, we will issue a public advisory detailing the vulnerability and the steps taken to resolve it.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the efforts of the security research community. To ensure a safe and coordinated disclosure:
- **Do Not Publicize:**  
  Please avoid public disclosure of the vulnerability until you have received confirmation from our Security Response Team that it has been resolved.
  
- **Follow-Up:**  
  We welcome follow-up communication if you need further clarification during the remediation process.

## Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of security researchers and community members who help us identify and resolve vulnerabilities.
